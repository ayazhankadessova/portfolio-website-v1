In this project first I scraped the data from the https://fa-fa.kz/search_load/gruzy-almaty/ with Beautiful Soup, using the fafa_Almaty.py script and wrote it in fafa_Almaty.csv.
Then I cleaned Data in fafa_Almaty.csv In fafa_Almaty.ipynb. <br>
After I introduced Data (shapre, data types, ...). <br>
Then I did an Exploratory Data Analysis. <br>
After that I answered 3 Business Questions through calculations and visualizations with seaborn and matplotlib.pyplot. <br>
At the end I presented Suggestions on a profitable business model. <br>
