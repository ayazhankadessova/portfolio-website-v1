          <p>
            Hello! My name is Aya! I am passionate about all things tech :){' '}
            <br />
            I love participating in hackathons â€“ I even travelled all the way to
            one in Denmark. We earned third place based on the latency and the
            number of data points! I shared my experience here. <br />
            I enjoy building projects independently for fun! While learning
            React.js, I built a TripGenie, a personalized trip itinerary
            generator with OpenAI API. Recently, I am also interested in Cloud
            Infrastructure Management, Monitoring and Observibility, exploring
            automation tools like Terraform in AWS, Azure, and other providers.
            I built a dev environment in Azure that I can SSH into to have my
            own redeployable environment & bootstrapped it with it with Docker
            for future projects. <br />
            I am also passionate about sharing my knowledge. My favorite event
            organized as a Women Techmakers Ambassador at Google is a web
            scraping workshop at HKBU with 100 participants. I have also
            mentored students in CS and Data Science at HKBU and Qwasar Silicon
            Valley Tech Talents Training.
            <br />
            To explore my leadership and community building skills even more, I
            am a Google Student Developer Club Lead at HKBU this year. I am so
            exited to create a community focused on tech at my campus!
